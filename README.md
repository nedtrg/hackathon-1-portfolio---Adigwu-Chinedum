# Portfolio Webpage

This is a personal portfolio webpage that showcases my work and projects with a clean, responsive design. The webpage features multiple sections with a separate page for each, allowing visitors to explore different aspects of my work. The site also includes a modern, user-friendly side menu that can be toggled using a hamburger icon. 

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
- **Side Menu**: A functional side navigation menu that slides in and out when the hamburger icon is clicked. This feature enhances the user experience by providing easy access to different sections without cluttering the layout.

- **Light/Dark Mode**: Integrated light and dark mode functionality that allows users to toggle between modes based on their preference. The theme changes dynamically and persists across sessions.

- **Separate Sections**: The portfolio has distinct pages for different sections, such as "About Me", "Projects", "Skills", and "Contact", offering a clear and organized layout.

## Technologies Used
